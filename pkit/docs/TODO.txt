TODO for PKI Tools

In no particular order (but the easy stuff is first)

- split out the fields from the default constructor (some to read from singleton reading from a properties file? 
	some to be prompted for (callback handler), some to be passed) and make more constructors
-  add JUnit tests
- make configurable to work with any provider
- put in apache commons logging with a default log4j logging  
- update documentation from EJBCA documentation where available
- chaining of certs
- implement a signer factory to and related classes to provide a uniform mechanism for signing using different algorithims
	(only RSA at first)
