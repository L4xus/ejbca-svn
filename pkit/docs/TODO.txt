TODO for PKI Tools

Immediate tasks:

- add methods that take an X509Name instead of just dn
- Add junit to the build file and write tests

In no particular order (but the easy stuff is first)

- update documentation from EJBCA documentation where available
- Retreive the password via a callback handler and write a sample callback handler
- make configurable to work with any provider
- put in apache commons logging with a default log4j logging  
- chaining of certs
- implement a signer factory to and related classes to provide a uniform mechanism for signing using different algorithims
	(only RSA at first)
