
Configuring for security
------------------------
The easiest way to keep the installation secure is to block all JBOSS ports (1099, 1476, 4444, 8082, 8083) from the outside and only allow traffic to Tomcat ports (8080).
This is because the public end-user actions can be performed through the public servlets, while administration tasks are performed directly on the beans.

See http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch11s03.html for a list of ports used in JBOSS.
See http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch13s84.html for information about security in JBOSS/EJB.
See http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2001/jw-0831-jaas_p.html for more examples about setting up role-permissions.
See http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch14s12.html on how to set up SSL with JBOSS/Tomcat.

BEAN PERMISSIONS
