This file describes how to build and use the stand alone OCSP and Lookup server client.

Setting up the OCSP and Lookup server:
-------------------------------------
See HOWTO-OCSP-RESPONDER.txt for information how to install and configure external OCSP responders and the Lookup server.

Building the OCSP/Lookup client.
-------------------------------
Run the command 'ant ocspclient.jar.
In the directory 'ocsp-dist' there is now a file called ocspclient.zip. This file can be moved to 
some other place and unzipped. It will unzip several files in the directory where you run the unzip command.
You can use it as a command line client by running 'ocsp-sh'. You can link to it and use the API by including 
the ocsplient.jar and the jar files in the 'lib' subdirectory in your build and class path.

Using the API
-------------
To learn the API by looking at the source code, since it is included. The client API is in the class 
org.ejbca.core.protocol.ocsp.OCSPUnidClient.
The command line client can serve as a good sample for using the API and it is in the class
org.ejbca.ui.cli.Ocsp.
