Set up a database for EJBCA in JBoss
====================================

The following databases have in some stage been tested with EJBCA:

* Hypersoniq (hsqldb) (default in JBoss)
* PostegreSQL 7.2 (http://www.postgresql.org/)
* MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/)
* Oracle 8i (http://www.oracle.com/)
* Sybase

Unless you are adventurous and know what you're doing, it is recommended to define
another datasource for ejbca and not reconfigure DefaultDS with another database
as you run the risk to jump into mapping bugs in the JBoss configuration and mess
up your server default configuration.

If all is well the automatic deployment script of EJBCA will configure all that for
you and you will be up and running in 30 seconds.

NOW ON TO THE HOWTO!

Troubleshooting database problems:
---------------------------------
* Have you configured a <database-ds.xml> in JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy?
* Do you have the correct username/password configured in <database-ds.xml>?
* Is the JDBC driver installed in JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib?
* Does you database accept incoming connection from the network, not only localhost or vice versa?
* Do you have a firewall blocking connections to the database?
* Can you connect to the database from another machine?
* Use ip-address instead of hostname in <database-ds.xml> (DNS problems?)

Configuring EJBCA
-----------------

0. Use 'ant clean' to clean up your repository if not already done.

1. Edit '.ejbca.properties' and specify the 'datasource.jndi-name' to the one you chose.
   For example: 'ejbcaDS'

   There is a .ejbca.properties.sample that is heavily commented.

2. Use 'ant deploy', it will configure automatically all deployment descriptors such
   as ejb-jar.xml, jbosscmp-jdbc.xml, according to the database/jndi-name you chose before.

  It will also copy ejbca-ds.xml to ${jboss.home}/server/default/deploy.
  This file defines your database configuration such as the driver, url, username, password.
  All other parameters are optional, so don't bother with them unless you know what you're doing.
  Of course this ejbca-ds.xml should define the jndi-name as 'ejbcaDS' (or whatever name you chose
  in the previous step)

  If something is wrong, you should see it in the logs of your application server


Configuring JBoss
-----------------

NOTE:

If you are using the default database HSQLDB: Nothing should be done, just install
JBoss and run.

The following is only if you want to replace the default database with another.

The description given here is for JBoss 3.x. Consider consulting the
official JBoss documentation.

Database configuration files in JBoss are located in the
<jboss-home>/server/default/deploy.

1. Install and setup the database your database.

2. Create a database for EJBCA (that is obviouslly the one you defined in .ejbca.properties)
Check your database documentation for more info (I know it is boring).

Typically for postgres: 'createdb -U postgres ejbca "database for ejbca"' will create
a database named 'ejbca' with description "database for ejbca" and with user postgres.

3. Put the JDBC driver for the database in <jboss-home>/server/default/lib/.

4. DONE! Start JBoss. Run tests with 'runtest.sh/cmd'.
