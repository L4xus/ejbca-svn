All defined administrator privileges must be redefined.

Certificate profiles should be redefined.

Drop tables GlobalConfigurationData, AdminGroupData,
AdminEntityData,

administrator privileges (actually deleting the content would be
enough but you
might as well drop the tables).

migrated.

the new
files.

EJBCA V1.2
----------
This is a plugin upgrade from v1.1. Just build and deploy the
new
files.

EJBCA V1.1
----------

Upgrading from version 1.0:

If upgrading from version 1.0 the database tables need to be
migrated if the
DN attributes L or ST have been used. This is because the
ordering of those
attributes have changed (for string matching the order must be
defined).

If L or ST have not been used in DNs, migration is NOT needed.

What need to be done are to:
1. Read column with DN to me migrated from table.
2. Run 'newDN=CertTools.stringToBCDNString(oldDN)'.
3. Update column with DN in table.

Columns that need updating are:
issuerDN in table CRLData
subjectDN, issuerDN in table CertificateData
subjectDN in table UserData.

If a tool is needed to perform the migration, please contact us.
