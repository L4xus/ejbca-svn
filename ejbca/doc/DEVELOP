Error, info and debug logs
--------------------------

Straight console output (System.out) MUST not be used in EJBCA except in
cases of console admin utilities.

EJBCA uses the Apache Log4J package for logging. This means that any class that
wants to do logging or console output MUST define:

    /** Log4j instance for Base */
    private static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(<class>.class.getName());

Logging is then done with:

    log.error("message");
    log.info("message");
    log.debug("message");

There is also a version of the command that takes an aditional Exception as
argument, were the exception stack will be printed to the log.

Where the log ends up is defined in 'log4j.properties'.

Some classes have special pre-prepared logging constructs. They are:

    BaseSessionBean.java
    BaseAdminCommand.java

This means that classes inheriting from one of these classes does not have to
define their own logger, but can simply use:

    error("message");
    info("message");
    debug("message");


Making session beans
--------------------

All session beans should inherit the class se.anatom.ejbca.BaseSessionBean.java.
When doing lookups for other beans from within the new bean, a simple construct
is provided and MUST be used:

For remote interfaces to other beans:

    /** Looks up a JNDI name using the (cached) InitialContext
     *@param jndiName the JNDI name to lookup.
     *@param type the class type to narrow the object to.
     *@return Object that can be casted to 'type'.
     */
    public Object lookup( String jndiName, Class type );


For local interfaces to other beans:
    /** Looks up a JNDI name using the (cached) InitialContext
     *@param jndiName the JNDI name to lookup.
     *@return Object that can be casted to 'type'.
     */
    public Object lookup( String jndiName);


CertificateStore/Publisher architecture
---------------------------------------

The CertificateStore/Publisher architecture is defined by the two interfaces
IPublisherSession and ICertificateStoreSession:

public interface IPublisherSession;
public interface ICertificateStoreSession extends IPublisherSession;

The CertificateStoreSession is the primary storage
for certificates and CRL. The CA always puts certificates and CRLs in the
CertificateStoreSession session bean defined in ca/ejb-jar.xml. The
CertificateStoreSession is also used to retrieve and find certificates,
retrieve CRLs, check for revocation etc. the CertificateStoreSession implements
the interface ICertificateStoreSession.

Certificates and CRLs can also be published to any number of other certificate
stores, which are defined by session beans PublisherSession1, PublisherSession2,
etc. A PublisherSession is a simple subset of the CertificateStoreSession and
can only be used to store certificates and CRLs. PublisherSession's implement
the interface IPublisherSession.

The IPublisherSession is a simple interface which is only used to store a
certificate or a CRL.
The ICertificateStoreSession extends the IPublisherSession interface with
capabilities to find certificates and CRL etc.
A class implementing the ICertificateStoreSession interface can thus also be
used a PublisherSession and a class implementing the IPublisherSession can
easily (well maybe not so easily) be extended to a fully fledged
CertificateStore.

This architecture gives us the choice of for example an SQL database aa
CertificateStoreSession where we also publish certificates to an LDAP directory,
or the LDAP directory as the primary CertificateStoreSession where we also
publish certificates to a specific SQL database for a specific purpose.
