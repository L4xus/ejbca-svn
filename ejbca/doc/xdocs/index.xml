  <section name="EJBCA Promotion: SafeSign IC &amp; CrypToken bundle">
  <note>
  SafeSign IC provides strong authentication and smart card logon on Windows, Linux and MAC. Combined with the CCID compatible steel Marx CrypToken USB token it is a perfect solution to use with an EJBCA PKI infrastructure.
  <br/>

<p>
EJBCA is a fully functional Certificate Authority. Based on J2EE technology it constitutes a robust,
high performance and component based CA. Both flexible and platform independent, EJBCA can be used
standalone or integrated in any J2EE application.
</p>
<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI, meaning that you can use EJBCA to build a complete PKI infrastructure for your organisation.
If you only want to issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably options that will get you started quicker, 
but if you want a serious PKI we recommend EJBCA.
</p>
<p><strong>EJBCA has everything for your trustcenter. Contact us for more info.</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can use EJBCA to issue certificates for different purposes such as:
<ul>
<li>Strong authentication for users accessing your intranet/extranet/internet resources.</li>
<li>Secure communication with SSL servers and SSL clients.</li>
<li><a href="howto.html#Microsoft smart card logon">Smart card logon</a> to Windows and/or Linux.</li>
<li>Signing and enrypting email.</li>
<li>VPN connections by issuing certificates to your VPN routers such as OpenVPN, Cisco, Juniper etc.</li>
<li>Client VPN access with certificates in users VPN clients.</li>
<li>Single sign-on by using a single certificate to secure logon to web applications.</li>
<li>Creating signed documents.</li>
<li>Issue citizen certificates for access to government resourses, used in passports etc.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Together with sister projects (see <i><a href="complimentary.html">Complimentary software</a></i>) of EJBCA you can also:
<ul>
<li>Get central trusted Time Stamps for you electronically signed documents.</li>
<li>Perform central signing of document.</li>
<li>Sign electronic passport data (MRTD).</li>
<li>Issue hard tokens (smart cards) and manage the complete lifecycle of cards and certificates.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
