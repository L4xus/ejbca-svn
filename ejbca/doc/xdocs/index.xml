EJBCA is a fully functional Certificate Authority. Based on J2EE technology it constitutes a robust,
high performance and component based CA. Both flexible and platform independent, EJBCA can be used
standalone or integrated in any J2EE application.
</p>
<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI, meaning that you can use EJBCA to build a complete PKI infrastructure for your organisation.
If you only want to issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably options that will get you started quicker, 
but if you want a serious PKI we recommend EJBCA.
</p>
<p>
You can use EJBCA to issue certificates for different purposes such as:
<ul>
<li>Strong authentication for users accessing your intranet/extranet/internet resources.</li>
<li>Secure communication with SSL servers and SSL clients.</li>
<li>Smart card based login to Windows and/or Linux.</li>
<li>Signing and enrypting email.</li>
<li>VPN connections by issuing certificates to your VPN routers such as OpenVPN, Cisco, Juniper etc.</li>
<li>Client VPN access with certificates in users VPN clients.</li>
<li>Single sign-on by using a single certificate to secure logon to web applications.</li>
<li>Creating signed documents.</li>
<li>Issue citizen certificates for access to government resourses, used in passports etc.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
