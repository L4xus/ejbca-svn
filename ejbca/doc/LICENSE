EJBCA is released under the LGPL license (see LICENSE-LGPL or
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.html).

To clarify, this means that (if I understand correctly):
The code itself (java code, tools, jars, etc) can NOT be changed without changed beeing 
put under the same licence as EJBCA..
Using the interfaces to use or integrate EJBCA in another project, without 
modifying EJBCA code is allowed and does not put any constraints on the product 
(the derived work).

Any modification to java code which is part of EJBCA should fall under LGPL.
For example creating a new MyAlgSigningSession (implementing interface
ISignSession) replacing the EJBCA RSASigningSession and deploying
MyAlgSigningSession by modifying src/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml to use the new 
MyAlgSigningSession should make MyAlgSigningSession a piece of LGPL code.

Taking EJBCA and integrating it into a web application by using the interfaces to 
the RA (IUserAdminSession) to create users for EJBCA from another source
(integrated with user registration in the application) does NOT put any 
constraints on the whole application itself. A notice that the application uses 
EJBCA and the possibility to get the source of EJBCA used in the application 
should be provided.
