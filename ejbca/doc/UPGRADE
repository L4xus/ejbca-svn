UPGRADE
=======

This document describes proceedures needed to upgrade from one 
version of EJBCA to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 2.0 to 2.0.1 for example, are 
usually plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new 
software.

From EJBCA 2.x to EJBCA 3.x
---------------------------
EJBCA 3 has several large database changes due to majur new features.

The upgrade process typically consists of:
1. ant replaceDS
2. ant deploy
3. ant upgrade
4. restart JBoss

Some things are not upgraded from ejbca2, and needs to be rebuilt after the upgrade 
(if you have used this function and customized).
