UPGRADE
=======

This document describes proceedures needed to upgrade from one 
version of EJBCA to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2 for example, are 
usually plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new 
software. See doc/RELEASE_NOTES for info about such upgrades.

From EJBCA 3.1.x to EJBCA 3.2
-----------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

1. Copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation. 
2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 
3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant deploy' (or deploywithjbossservice) with the new version.
4. Start up JBoss.
5. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the neccesary database updates.

If you don't want to do step 5 above (doing step 5 is the recommended way though) and instead want a 
quick-and-dirty upgrade of the database, do this instead of step 5:
- if you have NOT done any special Log Configurations and only used the default, 
- and you DO NOT mind deleting the EJBCA log entries from the database, i.e. you are not interested in the log history,
- and you DO NOT mind deleting your complete Certificate request history.

If the above three conditions are met, issue the following three commands to your database:
-----
delete from LogConfigurationData;
delete from LogEntryData;
delete from CertReqHistoryData;
-----

From EJBCA 3.1.x to EJBCA 3.1.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Otherwise simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation, 
copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

From EJBCA 3.0.x to EJBCA 3.1
-----------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

The upgrade process typically consists of:
1. Stop JBoss.
2. Remove JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/ejbca-ca.ear, the ear file changed name. 
   If you have configured a new datasource for EJBCA, remove this xml file as well.
3. Copy ejbca.properties.sample to ejbca.properties and configure. 
   You don't need to configure most options, since the installation is already done with EJBCA 3.0.x, 
   no new CAs will be created.
   Pay special attention to the upgrade comments for 'CA configuration' and 'Web GUI configuration', 
   it says what options you must configure.
   'Database configuration' is important if you changed from the default JBoss database.
4. run 'ant deploy'.
5. Copy JBOSS_HOME/bin/tomcat.jks to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/keystore/keystore.jks (note - name change).
5. Start JBoss.

Optional database migration
---------------------------
If you are using MySQL and:
1. Issues hard tokens using the hard token functionality of EJBCA AND uses images larger than 64KB
   in your card layouts.
or
2. Have CRLs that are larger than 64KB in size, or will become this large.

Then you should apply the following SQL commands on your MySQL database:

ALTER TABLE crldata MODIFY base64Crl longtext NULL DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE hardtokenprofiledata MODIFY data longtext NULL DEFAULT NULL;
