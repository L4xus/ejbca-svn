UPGRADE
=======

This document describes proceedures needed to upgrade from one 
version of EJBCA to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2 for example, are 
usually plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new 
software. See doc/RELEASE_NOTES for info about such upgrades.

If you use the patch file to upgrade use a command like:
- Have old version of ejbca unzipped to directory ejbca.
- Go to directory ejbca and apply patch with:
- patch --strip=0 -u < ../patch-321_322.txt
(change name of patch file depending on which version you are upgrading)

After this you must do:
- ant clean
- ant deploy

From EJBCA 3.2.x to EJBCA 3.3.x
-------------------------------
Upgrade from EJBCA 3.2.x to EJBCA 3.3.x is a plug-in upgrade, because there are
no database changes, or the database changes are only new tables and not changed ones.

You should still follow this advice:
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

Simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

You should be ablo to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.3.x, by following the same instructions
as when upgrading from 3.1.x to 3.2.x (untested though).

From EJBCA 3.2.x to EJBCA 3.2.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

From EJBCA 3.1.x to EJBCA 3.2
-----------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.
(If you are using weblogic, first copy weblogic.jar to EJBCA_HOME/lib)

The upgrade can consume a lot of memory if you have many users and certificates. You should make sure that your
memory parameters (-Xms and -Xmx) are sufficient. For 200.000 users it should be enough with '-Xms128m -Xmx512m', 
but in general you should consider using -Xmx1024m to be future proof. 
For JBoss these parameters are normally set in JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.conf.

1. Copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
2. Merge changes from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties, 
   specially datasource.jndi-name and datasource.jndi-name-prefix if you changed them from the default values.
3. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 
4. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant deploy' (or deploywithjbossservice) with the new version.
5. Start up JBoss.
6. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the neccesary database updates.

If you don't want to do step 6 above (doing step 6 is the recommended way though) and instead want a 
quick-and-dirty upgrade of the database, do this instead of step 6:
- if you have NOT done any special Log Configurations and only used the default, 
- and you DO NOT mind deleting the EJBCA log entries from the database, i.e. you are not interested in the log history,
- and you DO NOT mind deleting your complete Certificate request history.

If the above three conditions are met, issue the following three commands to your database:
-----
delete from LogConfigurationData;
delete from LogEntryData;
delete from CertReqHistoryData;
alter table UserData modify extendedInformationData LONGTEXT; (if NOT using MySQL, see src/upgrade/31_32 for commands for your specific database)

From EJBCA 3.1.x to EJBCA 3.1.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Otherwise simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties, 
specially datasource.jndi-name and datasource.jndi-name-prefix if you changed them from the default values.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

From EJBCA 3.0.x to EJBCA 3.1
-----------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

The upgrade process typically consists of:
1. Stop JBoss.
2. Remove JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/ejbca-ca.ear, the ear file changed name. 
   If you have configured a new datasource for EJBCA, remove this xml file as well.
3. Copy ejbca.properties.sample to ejbca.properties and configure. 
   You don't need to configure most options, since the installation is already done with EJBCA 3.0.x, 
   no new CAs will be created.
   Pay special attention to the upgrade comments for 'CA configuration' and 'Web GUI configuration', 
   it says what options you must configure.
   'Database configuration' is important if you changed from the default JBoss database.
4. run 'ant deploy'.
5. Copy JBOSS_HOME/bin/tomcat.jks to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/keystore/keystore.jks (note - name change).
5. Start JBoss.

Optional database migration
---------------------------
If you are using MySQL and:
1. Issues hard tokens using the hard token functionality of EJBCA AND uses images larger than 64KB
   in your card layouts.
or
2. Have CRLs that are larger than 64KB in size, or will become this large.

Then you should apply the following SQL commands on your MySQL database:

ALTER TABLE crldata MODIFY base64Crl longtext NULL DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE hardtokenprofiledata MODIFY data longtext NULL DEFAULT NULL;
